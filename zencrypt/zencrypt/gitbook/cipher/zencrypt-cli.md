# Zencrypt CLI

Zencrypt is a cryptographic project designed to enhance data security through encryption and hashing. The application is evolving from a command-line interface (CLI) to a modular, scalable, and user-friendly application featuring GUI and web-service capabilities. This document provides an overview of the project, enhancement plans, and the future roadmap.

## Enhancement Plan for Zencrypt CLI

Zencrypt aims to address modern cryptographic needs by incorporating a modular structure, advanced encryption techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. The enhancement plan focuses on the following key improvements:

### Core Enhancements

* **UI/UX Integration:** Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt.
* **Modular Structure:** Transition from a single-file CLI script to a modular architecture.
* **Web-Service Expansion:** Introduce a Flask/Django-based web-service to allow remote encryption/decryption.
* **Best Practices:** Adopt industry standards such as configuration files, logging, and environment variables for secure secret handling.

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Algorithms and Data Structures

* **Advanced Cryptography:** Integrate elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and Argon2 hashing.
* **Concurrency:** Optimize large file encryption using multithreading or multiprocessing.
* **Data Handling:** Use sophisticated data structures like queues and Merkle trees to enhance performance.

### Database Integration

* **Secure Storage:** Store keys, logs, and user information in a SQL or NoSQL database.
* **Authentication:** Implement user authentication and role-based access controls.
* **Key Management:** Add key rotation and expiry functionality for enhanced security.

## Architecture and Workflow

### High-Level Flowchart

1. **Startup:** Load configuration and environment variables.
2. **Logging & Initialization:** Set up modular architecture and log handlers.
3. **Interface Selection:** Choose between GUI, web-service, or CLI mode.
4. **Execution:**
   * **GUI Mode:** Launch a Tkinter/PyQt interface for user interaction.
   * **Web-Service Mode:** Run a Flask/Django server for remote operations.
   * **CLI Mode:** Present an updated menu with enhanced features.
5. **Database Operations:** Manage keys, logs, and encrypted data securely.
6. **Shutdown:** Close resources and save logs.

### Modular Components

* `config.py`: Handles configuration and environment variables.
* `crypto_ops.py`: Contains encryption and hashing algorithms.
* `cli.py`: Provides command-line functionality.
* `ui.py`: Manages the GUI.
* `web.py`: Implements web-service functionality.
