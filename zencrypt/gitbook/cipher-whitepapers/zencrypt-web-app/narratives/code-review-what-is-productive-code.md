# Code Review: What Is Productive Code?

### Code Review:

A good code review is the very foundation of developing solid software. Productive code review helps keep the code clean, scalable, and consistent from the start. With that said, by making it a habit to take the extra time to review my code before merging it into the main branch, I am able to catch bugs early and fix them. This practice helps to optimize the strength of the codebase and keep everything secure. None the less, sticking to consistent coding standards through regular reviews is what helps me make sure that each project turns out well.&#x20;

To do reviews as effectively as possible, I use checklists, automated tools that catch basic issues automatically, and to keep a steady focus on small and manageable changes. With that said, comments are a big part of this process as they need to be clear and helpful for future development. Feedback should also be kind, on time, and tailored towards the project’s goals. None the less, in my personal experience the best time to review code is right after any changes are made by pushing them to GitHub. This helps catch problems early and fix them before merging them into the main branch.

### Recording the Process for Zencrypt v4 and Planning Updates:

Note: The review was tailored towards structure, documentation, variables, and functionality.

To effectively review my Zencrypt CLI, I recorded a screencast using OBS Studio. I picked OBS because it’s easy to use and produces great results. During the recording, I ran the program in Visual Studio Code to show how the cipher works and to spot any issues in the code. Once the video was done, I uploaded it to YouTube. This made it easy to share since the review was over 30 minutes long, and I wanted to explain Zencrypt properly.

For the structure, I checked the flow of the menu, how files were organized, and whether the code followed good practices. Since Zencrypt v4 is just one Python script, it was simple to go through everything in detail. For the variables, I made sure the names of the variables were clear and that they didn’t create any conflicts. If I found bugs, I handled them and added comments where needed. For Zencrypt v5, I plan to make the code more modular and organized, which means grouping constants better for scalability. As for the documentation, I added clear comments throughout the script to explain the code and summarize its parts. I also used GitBooks to create a markdown repository to track edits and document Zencrypt’s transition from v4 to v5.

The screencast helped me review Zencrypt CLI v4 as a whole. By running the code and showing examples of the cipher, I spotted areas where I could improve its functionality, add more detailed comments, and refine the documentation. My goal is to make Zencrypt modular and scalable, which will make it easier to work with as it evolves into v5.

The screen capture that I recorded for Zencrypt CLI v4 was to effectively give an overall view of the project. In the video, I walked through the code step by step, running it to show how the cipher works and pointing out areas I want to improve or change. For me personally, this code review was a good way to think about what I want to add next for the cipher. As I went through it, I found places where I could enhance in terms of functionality, add more detailed comments, and clean up past documentation for v4. With that said, these changes are all aimed at making Zencrypt more modular and scalable, which will improve its quality as it expands into v5, which turns the CLI into a web-app with a clean UI/UX.

### Reflection on Consistent Improvement:

None the less, I believe that sticking to practicing good habits can make all the difference for developers and the outcome of the work. For example, a healthy habit to keep consistent in the development process is sticking to effective coding standards. That’s why I always review my code before pushing any changes to the public. This step is crucial to maintain an optimal standard in quality control. This can also be easily detrimental because even a small mistake like accidentally including an API key in the code can have big consequences. Therefore, it’s imperative to actually put in some extra effort and time to review being pushed or merged and make sure that the code is secure, contains no leaks, and meets a high standard.

None the less, in conclusion, consistently reviewing the code, especially before merging into the main branch, helps to show just how important it is to maintain quality and keep things running smoothly.
