# Skills and Illustrated Outcomes

Skills and Illustrated Outcomes:

* **Code Review:**
  * **Commitment to Quality Assurance:** Zencrypt will help to show off a strong dedication to high-quality software development through adhering to industry best practices, including modular design, clean coding standards, along with having comprehensive testing methods for QA.
  * **Project Development and Evolution:** My ePortfolio will be able to highlight my ability to take projects from a simple foundational concept to a professional and full-fledged product, incorporating advanced features such as GUI integration, web-based interfaces, and secure database connection.
  * **Cybersecurity Tools and Data Handling:** My ePortfolio will help to show that I have a strong proficiency and understanding in implementing encryption and cryptographic algorithms into my work which helps to show that I have a strong passion for cyber security and understanding about the way that data is properly managed and secured.
* **Narratives:**
  * **Detailed Thought Process:** I will document the thought process and reasoning behind each improvement, like comparing cryptographic methods (for example, ECC vs. SHA-256), improving speed with multitasking, all while following security best practices by adding features like rotating keys and using safe encryption methods.
  * **Scalability and Maintainability:** Showcasing all of my design choices, tailored mostly towards long-term scalability and ease of maintenance. For this example, I will be turning a single file CLI script into a modular web-based application.
  * **Real-World Problem Solving:** I will explain in the documentation for Zencrypt how these specific improvements help to solve real world cyber security challenges, with a focus on databases, secure data handling, encryption, and authentication.
* **Professional Self-Assessment:**
  *   **Skillset Take-aways:** Throughout my venture as a cybersecurity specialist and a computer science student, I have developed a strong skill set to help me move forward in the fields that I want to pursue. Some skills I have taken away from college are very powerful and solid foundationally.

      For example, understanding the fundamentals of databases, along with how to develop them or using Sequel or MongoDB to incorporate the ability to further integrate a reliable and secure connection to a database. Another example of a skillset I can take away from this program and add to my ePortfolio will be the understanding of cryptography and optimizing algorithms.

      With that said, these skills will be openly demonstrated through the Zencrypt roadmap and documentation, where I explain the logic applied behind the industry standard techniques that I will use for encryption and to develop a user-friendly and reliable UI/UX solution for managing sensitive data. The success of this project will help to properly project my ability to balance innovation with security and efficiency. My goal on this continent is to help in solving real-world problems in a constantly changing digital environment.
  *   **Full-Stack Development and Web-Service Architecture:** My skills in full-stack development and web-service architecture will be showcased with the release of Zencrypt v5, building on the foundation and expansion introduced in Zencrypt v4. The updated version will be built for scalability and feature a user-friendly UI/UX that will be powered by frameworks like Flask.

      This project will help to show my dedication to meeting goals and requirements while following industry standards, with a focus on consistently enhancing Zencryptâ€™s security and performance. My goal is to polish Zencrypt CLI into a final cyber security program that provides reliability, security and efficiency with advanced features yet keeps it simple and practical for all users.
  * **Proven Expertise:** By combining all of my technical skills with an understanding of industry needs, my ePortfolio will help to prove that I can not only understand but also help to solve problems in cyber security. My projects help to properly mirror my ability to deliver secure, scalable, and practical solutions that can go beyond any set expectations.
